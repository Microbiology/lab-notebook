I also created a table.

| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|:--------:|:--------:|
|   10     |    20    |
|   30     |    40    |

## Wrote R script to automate analysis

My R script is super cool. Be careful to not make errors!

```r
# This is super cool
x <- c(1,2,3)
```

## Attended awesome GitHub workshop

I learned about:

* GitHub
* Markdown
